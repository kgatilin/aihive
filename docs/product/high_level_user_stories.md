Objective:
To develop an AI-driven software development pipeline that enables autonomous AI coding agents to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal human oversight. The system will focus on structured delegation rather than direct oversight, shifting engineers into product validation and governance roles.

User Personas:

Engineering Manager: Ensures that the AI coding agent operates as expected and monitors its performance using dashboards and key metrics.

Product Manager: Responsible for defining product requirements and ensuring alignment with business objectives.

QA Engineer: Focuses on validating software functionality, security, and stability through automated testing frameworks. Ensures that acceptance criteria and BDD scenarios align with the product requirements.

Systems Architect: Ensures architectural integrity, system-wide compatibility, and adherence to best practices before execution begins.

User Stories:

Engineering Manager:

As an engineering manager, I want to monitor the AI coding agent's performance using a dashboard with key metrics so that I can ensure its effectiveness and reliability.

Product Manager:

As a product manager, I want to define product requirements in any format, and the AI Product Manager Agent will produce requirements in a structured format, asking me for confirmation along the way.

As a product manager, I want to validate AI-generated product requirements, including acceptance criteria, before they are finalized so that I can ensure alignment with business needs.

As a product manager, I want to ensure that the AI system develops a working product based on the structured requirements so that the final output aligns with my business objectives.

QA Engineer:

As a QA engineer, I want to validate AI-generated application contracts using automated integration tests and formal BDD scenarios so that I can ensure functional correctness and stability.

As a QA engineer, I want to run security compliance checks on AI-generated code so that I can prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced.

As a QA engineer, I want to have test coverage reports so that I can identify potential gaps in automated testing.

Systems Architect:

As a systems architect, I want to review AI-generated execution plans before coding begins so that I can ensure alignment with system design principles.

As a systems architect, I want to have architecture documentation generated before execution begins so that I can validate the overall system design and its compliance with best practices.

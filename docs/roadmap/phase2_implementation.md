# Phase 2 Implementation: Code Generation Workflow

## Overview

Phase 2 builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1 by implementing the code generation workflow. This phase focuses on enhancing the Orchestration Context and adding the Code Generation Context to transform approved Product Requirements into implementation code.

## Goals

- Implement the code generation workflow
- Enhance PRD validation with human checkpoints
- Create a flexible, extensible Coding Agent
- Implement code storage and versioning

## Domain Model Extensions

7. **Code Changes Requested**: Triggered when code review suggests changes
8. **Implementation Approved**: Triggered when code is approved
9. **Tests Generated**: Triggered when tests are created for the implementation
10. **Integration Ready**: Triggered when code is ready for integration

### Strategic Domain Design

#### New Aggregates

1. **Code Repository Aggregate**
   - Root: CodeRepository
   - Entities: CodeFile, CommitHistory
   - Value Objects: FilePath, CommitMessage
   - Invariants: Repository must have a valid structure

2. **Architecture Design Aggregate**
   - Root: ArchitectureDesign
   - Entities: Component, Interface
   - Value Objects: ComponentRelationship, DesignPrinciple
   - Invariants: Components must have defined interfaces

3. **Implementation Plan Aggregate**
   - Root: ImplementationPlan
   - Entities: CodeTask, TestTask
   - Value Objects: TaskPriority, TaskDependency
   - Invariants: Tasks must have dependencies resolved

#### Enhanced Domain Services

1. **ValidationCheckpointService**: Manages human validation points in the workflow
2. **CodeGenerationService**: Transforms requirements into implementable code
3. **ArchitectureDesignService**: Creates software architecture from requirements
4. **CodeReviewService**: Manages code review process and feedback
5. **TestGenerationService**: Creates tests for implemented code
6. **CodeStorageService**: Manages code versioning and organization

# Phase 1 Technical Specification

## Overview

This document provides detailed technical specifications for implementing Phase 1 of the AI-driven development pipeline, focusing on the product refinement workflow. The specification follows Domain-Driven Design principles to establish clear boundaries between domains and defines an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to support scalability and agent parallelization.

## Domain Model

### Bounded Contexts

The system is divided into the following bounded contexts:

1. **Human Interaction Context**
   - Responsible for all communications with human users
   - Manages message formatting and delivery
   - Handles notifications and user feedback
   - Provides asynchronous communication channels for user interactions

2. **Task Management Context**
   - Manages the lifecycle of tasks in the system
   - Responsible for status tracking and transitions
   - Maintains task metadata, comments, and assignments
   - Provides querying capabilities for task discovery and prioritization

3. **Product Definition Context**
   - Manages the creation and refinement of product requirements
   - Handles PRD versioning and history
   - Maintains structured product specifications
   - Processes assigned tasks asynchronously

4. **Orchestration Context**
   - Coordinates workflow between other bounded contexts
   - Manages the state machine of the overall process
   - Routes information between appropriate domains
   - Scans and schedules tasks periodically

### Core Domain Entities

#### Human Interaction Domain

- **Message**: A communication unit between the system and human users
- **Notification**: A structured alert to human users about system events
- **UserProfile**: Information about a human user interacting with the system
- **Channel**: A communication pathway to a specific user or group
- **RequestContext**: Context information for a user request (new or existing task)

#### Task Management Domain

- **Task**: The central work item tracking a request through the workflow
- **TaskStatus**: An enumeration of possible states for a task
- **Comment**: Feedback or notes attached to a task
- **TaskHistory**: A record of status changes and activities on a task
- **TaskAssignment**: Information about which agent is assigned to a task
- **TaskPriority**: The relative importance of a task for scheduling purposes

#### Product Definition Domain

- **ProductRequirement**: A structured definition of product specifications
- **RequirementVersion**: A specific iteration of product requirements
- **ClarificationRequest**: A question or request for additional information
- **RequirementStructure**: The organizational structure of a requirement document
- **RequirementLink**: A reference connecting a requirement to a task

#### Orchestration Domain

- **WorkflowState**: The current state of a process workflow
- **StateTransition**: A change from one workflow state to another
- **Agent**: An autonomous processor that performs specific functions
- **AgentInstruction**: A specific directive for an agent to execute
- **TaskScan**: A scheduled operation to find tasks needing attention
- **NotificationTrigger**: A condition that triggers user notification

### Task States and Transitions

The Task entity must always be in one of the following states:

1. **New**: Initial state when a task is created
   - Transitions to: Request Validation

2. **Request Validation**: Task is assigned to Product Manager for initial analysis
   - Transitions to: PRD Development, Clarification Needed, Cancelled

3. **Clarification Needed**: More information is required from the user
   - Transitions to: Request Validation

4. **PRD Development**: Product Manager is actively working on PRD
   - Transitions to: PRD Validation, Clarification Needed

5. **PRD Validation**: PRD is ready for human validation
   - Transitions to: Approved, Rejected

6. **Approved**: PRD has been approved by human validation
   - Transitions to: Completed

7. **Rejected**: PRD has been rejected and needs revision
   - Transitions to: PRD Development

8. **Completed**: Task has been successfully completed
   - Terminal state

9. **Cancelled**: Task has been cancelled
   - Terminal state

### Domain Events

The system is event-driven, with the following key domain events:

1. **UserRequestSubmitted**: Generated when a user submits a request
2. **TaskCreated**: Generated when a new task is initiated
3. **TaskStatusChanged**: Generated when a task transitions to a new status
4. **TaskAssigned**: Generated when a task is assigned to an agent
5. **TaskUnassigned**: Generated when a task assignment is removed
6. **CommentAdded**: Generated when a comment is added to a task
7. **ClarificationRequested**: Generated when more information is needed
8. **ClarificationProvided**: Generated when a user provides additional information
9. **ProductRequirementCreated**: Generated when a new PRD is created
10. **ProductRequirementUpdated**: Generated when a PRD is modified
11. **HumanValidationRequested**: Generated when human input is needed for validation
12. **HumanValidationProvided**: Generated when a human provides validation or feedback
13. **TaskScanInitiated**: Generated when the system begins scanning for tasks to process
14. **TaskScanCompleted**: Generated when a task scan cycle is completed

## Strategic Design

### Context Mapping

The following context maps define the relationships between bounded contexts:

```mermaid

    HIC[Human Interaction Context] -->|Customer/Supplier| OC[Orchestration Context]
    TMC[Task Management Context] -->|Shared Kernel| OC
    PDC[Product Definition Context] -->|Customer/Supplier| OC
    
    OC -->|Conformist| HIC
    OC -->|Published Language| TMC
    OC -->|Open Host Service| PDC
    
    MQ[Message Queue] -.->|Connects| HIC
    MQ -.->|Connects| OC
    MQ -.->|Connects| TMC
    MQ -.->|Connects| PDC
```

### Aggregates

1. **Task Aggregate**
   - Root: Task
   - Entities: Comments, TaskHistory, TaskAssignment
   - Value Objects: TaskPriority, TaskType, TaskStatus
   - Invariants: 
     - Task must always have a status and priority
     - Comments must be linked to a task
     - Status transitions must follow the defined state machine

2. **Product Requirement Aggregate**
   - Root: ProductRequirement
   - Entities: RequirementVersion, ClarificationRequest
   - Value Objects: RequirementStructure, RequirementMetadata
   - Invariants: 
     - Product requirement must have at least one version
     - Versions must be sequential
     - Requirement must link to an existing task

3. **User Interaction Aggregate**
   - Root: UserProfile
   - Entities: Channel, NotificationPreference
   - Value Objects: Message, Notification, RequestContext
   - Invariants: 
     - Messages must have a destination channel
     - Notifications must follow user preferences
     - Request context must be valid (new or existing task ID)

### Domain Services

## Asynchronous Processing

### Message Queue

The system uses a message queue to enable asynchronous processing:

1. **Event Bus**: Central message broker for all domain events
2. **Command Queue**: Prioritized queue for commands to be processed
3. **Task Assignment Queue**: Specialized queue for task assignments to agents
4. **Notification Queue**: Queue for user notifications

### Periodic Task Scanning

The Orchestration Context includes a Task Scanning Service that:

1. Runs at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
2. Queries the Task Repository for tasks in specific states
3. For "New" tasks:
   - Updates status to "Request Validation"
   - Assigns to Product Manager agent pool
   - Publishes TaskAssigned event
4. For tasks needing notification:
   - Identifies tasks requiring human interaction
   - Triggers appropriate notifications

### Agent Task Polling

The Product Definition Context includes a Task Polling Service that:

1. Periodically polls for tasks assigned to Product Manager agents
2. Selects tasks based on priority and other criteria
3. Processes the highest priority task
4. Updates task status based on processing results

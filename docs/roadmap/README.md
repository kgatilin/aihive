# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for the phased rollout of the AI-driven development pipeline. Each phase is designed to deliver incremental value while building towards the complete system architecture. The roadmap follows Domain-Driven Design principles to establish clear boundaries between domains and define the ubiquitous language for the system.

## Guiding Principles

Our implementation approach is guided by the following principles:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on core domain concepts and bounded contexts
2. **Incremental Value Delivery**: Each phase delivers tangible value to users
3. **Modularity**: Components are built with clear interfaces and separation of concerns
4. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Core domains are isolated from implementation details
5. **Event-Driven Communication**: Domain events drive system interactions
6. **Strategic Design**: Focus on domain relationships and context mapping
7. **Tactical Design**: Use appropriate patterns for entity, value object, and aggregate design

## Implementation Phases

### [Phase 1: Product Refinement Workflow](phase1_implementation.md)

**Timeline**: 2 months  
**Focus**: Building the foundation with the Product Definition Context

**Key Bounded Contexts**:
- Human Interaction Context
- Task Management Context
- Product Definition Context
- Orchestration Context

**Key Domain Events**:
- User Request Submitted
- Task Created
- PRD Development Needed
- Clarification Requested/Provided
- PRD Created/Updated

**Key Deliverables**:
- Core domain model implementation
- Domain event infrastructure
- Bounded context interfaces
- Ports and adapters for external systems
- Human validation checkpoints

### [Phase 2: Code Generation Workflow](phase2_implementation.md)

**Timeline**: 2 months  
**Focus**: Extending the domain model with Code Generation

**New Bounded Contexts**:
- Code Generation Context
- Code Storage Context

**Enhanced Contexts**:
- Orchestration Context (expanded)
- Human Interaction Context (expanded)

**Key Domain Events**:
- PRD Approved
- Architecture Design Completed

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)

**Timeline**: 3 months  
**Focus**: Advanced domain capabilities and deployment

**New Bounded Contexts**:
- Deployment Context
- Analytics Context
- Knowledge Context

**Key Domain Events**:
- Deployment Requested/Completed
- Analytics Generated
- Knowledge Updated

**Key Deliverables**:
- Extended domain model for deployment
- Integration with external systems

- Knowledge base for domain entities

### Phase 4: Scaling and Optimization (Planned)

**Timeline**: 3 months  
**Focus**: Enterprise readiness and performance

**New Bounded Contexts**:
- Security Context
- Performance Context
- Enterprise Integration Context

**Key Domain Events**:
- Authentication Events
- Performance Threshold Events
- Integration Events

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enhanced security domain model
- Performance optimization services
- Enterprise integration patterns
- Compliance and audit capabilities
- Multi-tenant support

## Strategic Design Approach

### Context Mapping

The system uses the following context mapping strategies:

1. **Customer/Supplier**: Between Human Interaction and Orchestration
2. **Conformist**: Between Task Management and Orchestration
3. **Open Host Service**: Between Product Definition and Orchestration
4. **Published Language**: Shared domain events across contexts
5. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Between external services and core domains

### Ubiquitous Language

We maintain a consistent language across bounded contexts, with terms like:

- **Task**: A unit of work tracked through the system
- **Requirement**: A specification for a product feature
- **Clarification**: Additional information needed for a requirement
- **Approval**: Human validation of a domain entity
- **Agent**: An autonomous processor that performs domain tasks

## Current Status

We are currently focused on implementing **Phase 1**, establishing the core domain model and product refinement workflow.

## Technical Approach

### Domain Model First

- Begin with domain modeling workshops
- Identify bounded contexts before implementation
- Define aggregates, entities, and value objects
- Establish domain event flows
- Create domain services

### Hexagonal Architecture

- Separate domain core from external dependencies
- Define ports (interfaces) before adapters
- Create adapters for different external systems
- Use dependency inversion for flexibility

### Event-Driven System

- Use domain events for cross-context communication
- Implement event sourcing for critical aggregates
- Create event handlers for state transitions
- Maintain event history for auditing

## Getting Started

To understand the implementation roadmap:

1. Start with the [Phase 1 Implementation Plan](phase1_implementation.md) to understand the foundation
2. Review the [Phase 2 Implementation Plan](phase2_implementation.md) for code generation capabilities
3. See the main [Architecture Documentation](../arch/README.md) for overall system design

## Next Steps

1. Complete domain model workshops for Phase 1
2. Implement core domain entities and aggregates
3. Create repositories and domain services
4. Develop event infrastructure
5. Implement adapters for external systems

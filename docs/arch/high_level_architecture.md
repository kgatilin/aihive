# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: High-Level Architecture

## Overview

This document details the high-level architecture for an AI-driven software development pipeline that enables autonomous AI coding agents to build applications with human validation at key checkpoints. Building on the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md), this document focuses on system workflows, architectural decisions, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Core Components

The architecture consists of five primary components, which are detailed in the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) document:

1. **Human Interface**: Entry point for requirements and validation
2. **Task Tracking System**: Manages workflow status and progression
3. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates workflow and assigns tasks to specialized agents
4. **Product Agent**: Processes requirements and generates specifications
5. **Coding Agent**: Generates code based on specifications

## System Workflows

### 1. Requirements Processing Workflow

    participant User
    participant HI as Human Interface
    participant TTS as Task Tracking System
    participant OA as Orchestrator Agent
    participant PA as Product Agent
    participant Git as Git Repository
    
    User->>HI: Submit requirements
    HI->>Git: Store PRD as markdown
    HI->>TTS: Create task with PRD link
    TTS->>OA: Notify of new task
    OA->>TTS: Update status (VerifyingPRD)
    OA->>PA: Assign for processing
    PA->>Git: Fetch PRD markdown
    PA->>PA: Analyze & structure
    
    alt PRD needs clarification
        PA->>OA: Report clarification needed
        OA->>HI: Request clarification
        User->>HI: Provide feedback
        HI->>OA: Submit clarification
        OA->>PA: Forward clarification
        PA->>Git: Update PRD
    end
    
    PA->>OA: Submit structured requirements
    OA->>TTS: Update status (VerifyingAcceptanceCriteria)
    OA->>HI: Request validation
    User->>HI: Approve requirements
    HI->>OA: Confirm approval
    OA->>TTS: Update status (VerifyingArchitecture)
```

### 2. Code Generation Workflow

    OA->>CA: Assign for development
    OA->>TTS: Update status (InDevelopment)
    CA->>CA: Generate code
    CA->>Git: Commit code
    CA->>OA: Report code completion
    
    OA->>TTS: Update status (CodeReview)
    OA->>HI: Request code review
    User->>HI: Approve code
    HI->>OA: Confirm approval
    
    OA->>CA: Request tests
    CA->>Tests: Create & run tests
    Tests->>OA: Report test results
    OA->>TTS: Update status (Testing)
    OA->>HI: Present test results
    User->>HI: Approve for deployment
    HI->>OA: Confirm approval
    OA->>TTS: Update status (ReadyForDeployment)
```

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Microservices Architecture
- **Decision**: Adopt a microservices architecture for AI-generated applications
- **Rationale**: 
  - Limits each AI agent's context to specific domains
  - Enables focused development with clear interfaces
  - Reduces risk of cascading failures
  - Allows for progressive enhancements

### AD-2: Git-Based PRD Management
- **Decision**: Store product requirements as markdown files in Git
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides version control for requirements
  - Enables transparent change tracking
  - Facilitates human readability and editing
  - Integrates with existing development workflows

### AD-3: Orchestrator-Driven Workflow
- **Decision**: Use a dedicated Orchestrator Agent to manage workflow progression
- **Rationale**:
  - Centralizes workflow coordination logic
  - Allows specialized agents to focus on their specific tasks
  - Provides a single point of control for workflow state
  - Ensures consistency in task transitions and status updates

### AD-4: Human Validation Checkpoints
- **Decision**: Implement mandatory human validation at key decision points
- **Rationale**:
  - Ensures alignment with business objectives
  - Prevents propagation of errors or misunderstandings
  - Maintains human governance over critical decisions
  - Builds trust in the AI-driven process

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for different user types
- Least privilege access for AI agents
- API access controls with strong authentication

### Code Security
- Automated security scanning for AI-generated code
- Pre-commit validation for security standards
- Regular vulnerability assessments

### Data Protection
- Encryption for sensitive requirements
- Access logging for all system interactions
- Validation of data integrity across transformations

## Scalability Considerations

### Agent Scaling
- Stateless AI agent design allows horizontal scaling
- Independent scaling of Orchestrator, Product, and Coding agents
- Containerized deployment enables dynamic resource allocation

### Task Distribution
- Asynchronous task processing reduces coupling
- Task prioritization for efficient resource utilization
- Parallel processing of independent tasks

# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: High-Level Architecture

## Overview

This document details the high-level architecture for an AI-driven software development pipeline that enables autonomous AI coding agents to build applications with human validation at key checkpoints. Building on the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md), this document focuses on system workflows, architectural decisions, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Core Components

The architecture consists of four primary components, which are detailed in the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) document:

1. **Human Interface**: Entry point for requirements and validation
2. **Task Tracking System**: Manages workflow status and progression
3. **Product Agent**: Processes requirements and generates specifications
4. **Coding Agent**: Generates code based on specifications

## System Workflows

### 1. Requirements Processing Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant HI as Human Interface
    participant TTS as Task Tracking System
    participant PA as Product Agent
    participant Git as Git Repository
    
    User->>HI: Submit requirements
    HI->>Git: Store PRD as markdown
    HI->>TTS: Create task with PRD link
    TTS->>PA: Assign for processing
    PA->>Git: Fetch PRD markdown
    PA->>TTS: Update status (VerifyingPRD)
    alt PRD needs clarification
        PA->>HI: Request clarification
        User->>HI: Provide feedback
        PA->>Git: Update PRD
    end
    PA->>TTS: Submit structured requirements
    TTS->>HI: Request validation
    User->>HI: Approve requirements
```

### 2. Code Generation Workflow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant HI as Human Interface
    participant TTS as Task Tracking System
    participant CA as Coding Agent
    participant Git as Git Repository
    
    TTS->>CA: Assign for development
    CA->>TTS: Submit architecture plan
    TTS->>HI: Request validation
    User->>HI: Approve plan
    CA->>TTS: Submit execution plan
    TTS->>HI: Request validation
    User->>HI: Approve plan
    CA->>TTS: Update status (InDevelopment)
    CA->>Git: Commit code
    CA->>TTS: Update status (CodeReview)
    TTS->>HI: Request code review
    User->>HI: Approve code
    CA->>TTS: Run tests
    TTS->>HI: Present test results
    User->>HI: Approve for deployment
```

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Microservices Architecture
- **Decision**: Adopt a microservices architecture for AI-generated applications
- **Rationale**: 
  - Limits each AI agent's context to specific domains
  - Enables focused development with clear interfaces
  - Reduces risk of cascading failures
  - Allows for progressive enhancements

### AD-2: Git-Based PRD Management
- **Decision**: Store product requirements as markdown files in Git
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides version control for requirements
  - Enables transparent change tracking
  - Facilitates human readability and editing
  - Integrates with existing development workflows

### AD-3: Task Status-Driven Orchestration
- **Decision**: Drive workflow progression through explicit task statuses
- **Rationale**:
  - Creates clear visibility of work in progress
  - Enables precise targeting of human validation points
  - Provides consistent process across different task types
  - Facilitates automation based on well-defined transitions

### AD-4: Human Validation Checkpoints
- **Decision**: Implement mandatory human validation at key decision points
- **Rationale**:
  - Ensures alignment with business objectives
  - Prevents propagation of errors or misunderstandings
  - Maintains human governance over critical decisions
  - Builds trust in the AI-driven process

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for different user types
- Least privilege access for AI agents
- API access controls with strong authentication

### Code Security
- Automated security scanning for AI-generated code
- Pre-commit validation for security standards
- Regular vulnerability assessments

### Data Protection
- Encryption for sensitive requirements
- Access logging for all system interactions
- Validation of data integrity across transformations

## Scalability Considerations

### Agent Scaling
- Stateless AI agent design allows horizontal scaling
- Independent scaling of Product and Coding agents
- Containerized deployment enables dynamic resource allocation

### Task Distribution
- Asynchronous task processing reduces coupling
- Task prioritization for efficient resource utilization
- Parallel processing of independent tasks

# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: Component Architecture

## Introduction

This document details the internal architecture of each major component in the AI-driven development pipeline, including their interfaces, data models, and interaction patterns. The component architecture serves as a blueprint for implementation, providing specific guidance on how components should be structured and how they should interact.

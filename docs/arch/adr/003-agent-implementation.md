# ADR 003: Agent Implementation Strategy

## Context

As part of Phase 1 implementation of the AI-driven development pipeline, we need to design and implement the AI agents that will handle the product refinement workflow. The implementation should follow the asynchronous, event-driven architecture outlined in the technical specifications, while ensuring clean separation of concerns and proper domain boundaries.

## Decision

We will implement the following agent components:

1. **Product Manager Agent (PMA)**
   - Responsible for analyzing user requests and creating product requirement documents
   - Operates asynchronously by polling for assigned tasks
   - Implements domain logic for requirement structuring and clarification management

2. **Orchestrator Agent (OA)**
   - Coordinates overall workflow between contexts
   - Manages state transitions and task assignments
   - Implements scheduling logic for task processing

3. **Task Polling Service (TPS)**
   - Periodically polls for tasks assigned to agents
   - Prioritizes tasks based on business rules
   - Invokes appropriate agent logic based on task properties

4. **Agent Tool Framework**
   - Provides a structured way for agents to interact with the system
   - Implements tool interfaces for common operations
   - Ensures proper authorization and validation for agent actions

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of agent responsibilities aligned with domain boundaries
- Asynchronous processing enables scalability and parallelization
- Polling-based architecture avoids tight coupling between components
- Event-driven design allows for extensibility and future enhancements

### Negative

- Polling introduces inherent latency in task processing
- More complex to debug due to asynchronous nature
- Needs careful handling of concurrent task processing
- Requires comprehensive testing of event flows and edge cases

## Implementation Strategy

1. Implement agent interfaces and base classes
2. Create concrete agent implementations following TDD principles
3. Develop the task polling service with priority-based scheduling
4. Implement agent tools for common operations
5. Create comprehensive unit tests for agent behavior
6. Develop integration tests for event handling and state transitions

## Compliance

This architecture adheres to the Clean Architecture principles by:
- Maintaining proper separation of concerns
- Using dependency inversion for testability
- Keeping domain logic isolated from infrastructure details
- Defining clear interfaces between components

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All agent components must have >90% test coverage
2. Agent implementations must properly handle all defined domain events
3. Task polling must respect priority rules and ensure fair scheduling
4. Agents must operate within their bounded contexts
5. Error handling must be robust with proper recovery mechanisms
6. All asynchronous operations must be properly tracked and monitored

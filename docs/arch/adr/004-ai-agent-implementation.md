# ADR 004: AI-powered Agents Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires implementing AI-powered agents to handle various tasks such as product requirement analysis, orchestration, and task management. These agents need to leverage large language models (LLMs) to enable intelligent decision-making capabilities.

Key considerations include:
1. How to integrate LLMs into our agent framework
2. Which AI provider and models to use
3. How to structure the agent system to utilize AI effectively
4. How to ensure consistency and reliability in AI-based decision making

## Decision

We will implement AI-powered agents using the following approach:

1. **LangChain Integration**:
   - We will use LangChain as our primary framework for LLM integration
   - This provides a structured way to interact with various LLM providers and manage prompts

2. **AI Models**:
   - Primary model: OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-turbo-preview)
   - Fallback mechanisms will be implemented for all AI operations to ensure robustness

3. **Agent Architecture**:
   - Create a base `AIAgent` class that handles common LLM operations
   - Implement specialized agents (ProductManagerAgent, OrchestratorAgent) that inherit from this base class
   - Each agent will have a specific system prompt tailored to its responsibilities

4. **Configuration**:
   - API keys and model settings will be configurable via environment variables
   - Default values will be provided but can be overridden

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Each AI-powered operation will have a fallback implementation if the AI fails

## Consequences

### Positive

- Agents will be able to make intelligent decisions based on natural language understanding
- The system becomes more flexible and can handle a wider variety of inputs
- Reduced need for hard-coded logic as agents can reason about requirements
- Easier to adapt to new types of tasks through prompt engineering

### Negative

- Dependency on external API services (OpenAI)
- Cost implications for API usage
- Potential for non-deterministic behavior from AI models
- Need for careful monitoring and prompt engineering to ensure quality results

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for all AI operations
- Caching strategies to reduce API calls where appropriate
- Thorough testing with various input types
- Monitoring and logging of all AI interactions for quality assessment

## Implementation Details

1. **Base AIAgent Class**:
   - Handles common LLM operations
   - Manages prompt creation and response parsing
   - Provides tool integration framework

2. **ProductManagerAgent**:
   - Uses AI to analyze product requirements
   - Generates clarification questions when needed
   - Creates structured product requirement documents

3. **OrchestratorAgent**:
   - Intelligently assigns tasks to specialized agents
   - Manages workflow between agents
   - Handles failure recovery

4. **Configuration**:
   - Environment variables for API keys and model settings
   - Centralized configuration management

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Using a rules-based approach without AI**:
   - Would be more deterministic but less flexible
   - Would require extensive coding for each type of analysis
   - Rejected due to limitations in natural language understanding

2. **Direct integration with OpenAI API**:
   - More control over the exact implementation
   - Less abstraction for different providers
   - Rejected in favor of LangChain's flexibility and additional features

3. **Using other AI frameworks**:
   - Considered alternatives like LlamaIndex, Haystack, etc.
   - LangChain selected for its comprehensive features and active development

# ADR 005: Product Requirements Storage Mechanism

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The project requires a reliable storage mechanism for product requirements that provides:
1. Persistence across system restarts
2. Version history and audit trail
3. Structured querying capabilities
4. Support for document-oriented data
5. Integration with the existing architecture

Currently, the implementation has some inconsistencies:
- The code suggests the use of MongoDB as the storage for product requirements
- The architecture documentation emphasizes Git-based storage for requirements
- There's an in-memory implementation for development/demo purposes

We need to clarify the intended storage approach and define a clear path forward.

## Decision

We will implement a dual-storage approach for product requirements:

1. **Primary Storage: MongoDB**
   - MongoDB will be used as the operational database for product requirements
   - Provides flexible schema for storing structured requirement documents
   - Allows for efficient querying and indexing
   - Supports the async operations needed for the application

2. **Archival Storage: Git Repository**
   - Product requirements will be periodically exported to Markdown files in Git
   - Provides long-term version history
   - Enables human review and editing
   - Facilitates collaboration through pull requests and reviews

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - The `ProductRequirementRepository` interface will be implemented by a MongoDB-based repository
   - An additional service will handle synchronization to Git
   - The in-memory implementation will be maintained for testing purposes

## Consequences

### Positive

- MongoDB provides robust operational storage with efficient querying
- Git provides excellent version control and collaboration capabilities
- Both systems have good ecosystem support and integrations
- The dual approach leverages strengths of both systems

### Negative

- Increased complexity with two storage systems
- Potential synchronization issues between MongoDB and Git
- Additional development effort to maintain both implementations

### Mitigations

- Clear boundaries between operational usage (MongoDB) and archival/collaboration (Git)
- Automated synchronization processes with validation
- Comprehensive testing of both storage mechanisms
- Fallback procedures if either system becomes unavailable

## Implementation Details

1. **MongoDB Repository Implementation**:
   - Implement `MongoDBProductRequirementRepository` that satisfies the `ProductRequirementRepositoryInterface`
   - Use MongoDB's document model for storing requirement documents
   - Implement proper indexes for efficient querying
   - Support for all CRUD operations

2. **Git Synchronization Service**:
   - Develop a service that exports requirements to Markdown files
   - Schedule regular synchronization to Git
   - Include metadata in frontmatter for tracking
   - Handle conflict resolution

3. **Configuration**:
   - Environment variables for MongoDB connection
   - Configuration options for Git repository location and credentials
   - Toggle for enabling/disabling Git synchronization

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MongoDB Only**:
   - Simpler implementation
   - Less storage redundancy
   - Rejected due to lack of Git's collaboration features

2. **Git Only**:
   - Better alignment with documentation
   - Simpler version control
   - Rejected due to performance limitations for operational queries

3. **PostgreSQL with JSONB**:
   - Strong transactional guarantees
   - Combined relational and document capabilities
   - Rejected due to less flexibility compared to MongoDB for document storage

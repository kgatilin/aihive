# ADR 005: Product Requirements Storage Mechanism

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a reliable storage mechanism for product requirements that provides:
1. Persistence across system restarts
2. Version history and audit trail
3. Structured querying capabilities
4. Support for document-oriented data
5. Integration with the existing architecture

Currently, the implementation has some inconsistencies:
- The code suggests the use of MongoDB as the storage for product requirements
- The architecture documentation emphasizes Git-based storage for requirements
- There's an in-memory implementation for development/demo purposes

We need to clarify the intended storage approach and define a clear path forward.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-storage approach for product requirements:

1. **Primary Operational Storage Options**
   - **MongoDB**: Used as the default operational database for product requirements
     - Provides flexible schema for storing structured requirement documents
     - Allows for efficient querying and indexing
     - Supports the async operations needed for the application
   - **File-based Storage**: Simple JSON file-based storage as an alternative
     - Provides persistence without requiring a database server
     - Easier to set up for development and testing
     - Each requirement stored as a separate JSON file with an index for quick lookups

2. **Archival Storage: Git Repository**
   - Product requirements will be periodically exported to Markdown files in Git
   - Provides long-term version history
   - Enables human review and editing
   - Facilitates collaboration through pull requests and reviews

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - The `ProductRequirementRepository` interface has implementations for both MongoDB and file-based storage
   - Storage type is configurable via configuration file or environment variables
   - An additional service will handle synchronization to Git
   - The in-memory implementation will be maintained for testing purposes

## Consequences

### Positive

- Multiple storage options provide flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- MongoDB provides robust operational storage with efficient querying
- File-based storage offers simplicity for development and small deployments
- Git provides excellent version control and collaboration capabilities
- Configuration allows teams to choose the most appropriate storage for their needs

### Negative

- Increased complexity with multiple storage systems
- Need to maintain multiple repository implementations
- Potential synchronization issues between operational and archival storage
- File-based storage may have performance limitations for large datasets

### Mitigations

- Clear boundaries between operational usage and archival/collaboration
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure all storage implementations behave consistently
- Automated synchronization processes with validation
- Fallback procedures if either system becomes unavailable

## Implementation Details

1. **Storage Configuration**:
   - `product_definition.storage_type` configuration option (values: "mongodb", "file")
   - Environment variable `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENT_STORAGE_TYPE` 
   - Default is "mongodb" for backward compatibility

2. **MongoDB Repository Implementation**:
   - Implements `MongoDBProductRequirementRepository` that satisfies the `ProductRequirementRepositoryInterface`
   - Use MongoDB's document model for storing requirement documents
   - Implement proper indexes for efficient querying
   - Support for all CRUD operations

3. **File-based Repository Implementation**:
   - Implements `FileProductRequirementRepository` that satisfies the `ProductRequirementRepositoryInterface`
   - Each requirement stored as a separate JSON file
   - Maintains an index file for quick lookups
   - File path configurable via `product_definition.file_storage_dir` or `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENT_FILE_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable

4. **Git Synchronization Service** (future work):
   - Will develop a service that exports requirements to Markdown files
   - Schedule regular synchronization to Git
   - Include metadata in frontmatter for tracking
   - Handle conflict resolution

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MongoDB Only**:
   - Simpler implementation
   - Less storage redundancy
   - Rejected due to lack of Git's collaboration features and higher setup requirements

2. **Git Only**:
   - Better alignment with documentation
   - Simpler version control
   - Rejected due to performance limitations for operational queries

3. **PostgreSQL with JSONB**:
   - Strong transactional guarantees
   - Combined relational and document capabilities
   - Rejected due to less flexibility compared to MongoDB for document storage

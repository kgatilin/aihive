# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the security architecture for the AI-driven development pipeline. It identifies potential security risks, defines security controls, and establishes best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Given the unique risks associated with AI agents autonomously generating code, this architecture places special emphasis on isolation, verification, and defense-in-depth strategies.

## Security Principles

The security architecture is guided by the following core principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect against a wide range of threats. No single security measure is relied upon exclusively.

### 2. Least Privilege

All components, services, and users are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their functions. This minimizes the potential impact of security breaches.

### 3. Secure by Default

Security is built into the system from the beginning, with secure configurations as the default setting. Security is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

### 4. Continuous Verification

Automated and manual verification is performed throughout the development pipeline to ensure security requirements are met. This includes code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and human review.

### 5. Segregation of Duties

Critical functions are separated to ensure no single entity (human or AI) has complete control over sensitive processes. This reduces the risk of malicious actions or accidental errors.

## Threat Model

### Threat Actors

1. **External Attackers**: Unauthorized individuals attempting to gain access to the system
2. **Malicious Insiders**: Authorized users with malicious intent
3. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Sophisticated attackers targeting specific organizations
4. **AI Hallucinations**: Unexpected or incorrect behaviors from AI agents
5. **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Attempts to manipulate AI behavior through crafted inputs

### Attack Vectors

1. **Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: Exploitable weaknesses in the underlying infrastructure
2. **Application Vulnerabilities**: Security flaws in the application code
3. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or third-party components
4. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating humans to bypass security controls
5. **Credential Theft**: Unauthorized access to authentication credentials
6. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized removal of sensitive data
7. **AI Manipulation**: Deliberate attempts to make AI agents generate insecure code

### Potential Impacts

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Access to sensitive information or systems
2. **Data Breach**: Exposure of confidential or sensitive information
3. **System Compromise**: Control or manipulation of system components
4. **Denial of Service**: Disruption of system availability
5. **Code Injection**: Introduction of malicious code into the codebase
6. **Intellectual Property Theft**: Theft of proprietary code or algorithms
7. **Reputational Damage**: Loss of trust from users or customers

## Security Controls

### 1. AI Agent Isolation

#### Containerization

AI agents operate within strictly defined containerized environments with:

- **Resource Limits**: Explicit CPU, memory, and storage constraints
- **Network Isolation**: No direct outbound internet access
- **Volume Restrictions**: Read-only access to system resources
- **Privilege Restrictions**: Non-root execution with minimal capabilities

#### Example Docker Security Configuration

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Create non-root user
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Define command
CMD ["python", "agent.py"]
```

#### Example Kubernetes Security Context

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
```

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

#### Identity Management

# AI-Driven Development Pipeline - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AI-Driven Development Pipeline is an innovative system designed to enable AI agents to autonomously generate software under human guidance and validation. The architecture emphasizes appropriate human oversight while leveraging AI capabilities for increased development efficiency.

## Documentation Structure

This directory contains the following architecture documentation:

- **[Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md)** - High-level summary of the architecture
- **[High-Level Architecture](high_level_architecture.md)** - System structure and workflows
- **[Component Architecture](component_architecture.md)** - Detailed component specifications
- **[Data Flow Architecture](data_flow_architecture.md)** - Data transformations through the system
- **[Security Architecture](security_architecture.md)** - Security controls and considerations
- **[Technology Stack](technology_stack.md)** - Implementation technologies
- **[Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md)** - Phased approach to building the system
- **[Diagrams](diagrams/)** - Architecture visualizations

## Key Components

The architecture is composed of five primary components:

1. **Human Interface** - Entry point for requirements submission and human validation
2. **Task Tracking System** - Central system for managing workflow status and progression
3. **Orchestrator Agent** - Manages workflow progression and assigns tasks to specialized agents
4. **Product Agent** - AI agent that transforms raw requirements into structured specifications
5. **Coding Agent** - AI agent that generates code based on structured requirements

## Key Architectural Principles

The following principles guide the architecture:

1. **Human Validation Checkpoints** - Critical stages require human review and approval
2. **Git-Based Requirements** - Requirements managed as markdown in version control
3. **Event-Driven Communication** - Components communicate via events to reduce coupling
4. **Task-Centric Workflow** - All activities organized around tasks with explicit status
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Each agent specializes in a specific transformation type

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md) to understand the system at a high level
2. Proceed to the [High-Level Architecture](high_level_architecture.md) to understand system workflows
3. Explore component details based on your area of focus

### For Implementers

1. Refer to the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) for detailed specifications
2. Consult the [Technology Stack](technology_stack.md) for implementation guidance
3. Follow the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for phased approach

### For Security Reviewers

1. Focus on the [Security Architecture](security_architecture.md) document
2. Cross-reference with workflow diagrams in the [High-Level Architecture](high_level_architecture.md)
3. Review data flows in the [Data Flow Architecture](data_flow_architecture.md)

## Maintaining This Documentation

- Update diagrams when significant architectural changes occur
- Ensure all component changes are reflected in relevant documentation
- Version documentation alongside code changes
- Conduct architecture reviews when adding new capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Foundation phase components
2. Create actual diagrams based on the mermaid snippets
3. Refine architecture as implementation progresses
4. Develop detailed designs for each component

# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the AI-driven development pipeline project. The architecture is designed to enable autonomous AI coding agents to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal human oversight, shifting engineers to product validation and governance roles.

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized into the following components:

### Core Architecture Documents

1. [**Architecture Overview**](architecture_overview.md) - High-level summary of the architecture, its goals, and key components
2. [**High-Level Architecture**](high_level_architecture.md) - Detailed description of the system architecture, components, and workflows
3. [**Component Architecture**](component_architecture.md) - Detailed specifications of each major component and their internal structure
4. [**Data Flow Architecture**](data_flow_architecture.md) - Descriptions of how data moves through the system and is transformed
5. [**Security Architecture**](security_architecture.md) - Security considerations, controls, and implementation strategies
6. [**Technology Stack**](technology_stack.md) - Recommended technologies, frameworks, and tools for implementation
7. [**Implementation Plan**](implementation_plan.md) - Phased approach to building the system with milestones and resources

### Diagrams

The [**diagrams**](diagrams/) directory contains visual representations of the architecture, including:

- System context diagrams
- Component diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Deployment diagrams

See the [Diagrams README](diagrams/README.md) for more information on the diagram types and standards.

### Reference Materials

The project's concept and user stories can be found in:

- [Product Concept](../product/concept.md)
- [High-Level User Stories](../product/high_level_user_stories.md)

## Key Architectural Concepts

The architecture is built on several key concepts:

1. **AI Agent Ecosystem** - A set of specialized AI agents working together to generate code from requirements
2. **Microservices Architecture** - A modular approach that enables isolation and independent development
3. **Defense-in-Depth Security** - Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various threats
4. **Human Validation Checkpoints** - Strategic points where human experts review and approve system outputs
5. **Event-Driven Communication** - Asynchronous messaging patterns to coordinate activities between components

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md) to understand the big picture
2. Review the [High-Level Architecture](high_level_architecture.md) for more detailed component information
3. Explore specific areas of interest (data flows, security, technology) as needed

### For Implementers

1. Review the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) for your specific component
2. Consult the [Technology Stack](technology_stack.md) for recommended implementation technologies
3. Follow the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for phasing and milestones

### For Security Reviewers

1. Focus on the [Security Architecture](security_architecture.md) document
2. Review security aspects in the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md)
3. Check the [Data Flow Architecture](data_flow_architecture.md) for data protection controls

## Maintaining This Documentation

The architecture documentation should be treated as a living set of documents that evolve with the project. When making significant changes to the architecture:

1. Update the relevant architecture documents
2. Update or create new diagrams as needed
3. Document architectural decisions using the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format
4. Notify the team of significant architectural changes

## Next Steps

After reviewing the architecture documentation, the recommended next steps are:

1. Set up the core infrastructure for development
2. Begin implementation of the Foundation phase components
3. Establish a regular architecture review process
4. Create detailed designs for each component based on this architecture

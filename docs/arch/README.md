# AI-Driven Development Pipeline: Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the AI-driven development pipeline project. The architecture is designed to enable autonomous AI coding agents to build, test, and deploy applications with appropriate human oversight.

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized into a concise set of documents:

1. [**Architecture Overview**](architecture_overview.md) - High-level summary of the architecture, its goals, and key components
2. [**High-Level Architecture**](high_level_architecture.md) - System workflows, architectural decisions, and cross-cutting concerns
3. [**Component Architecture**](component_architecture.md) - Detailed component specifications and task lifecycle flows
4. [**Data Flow Architecture**](data_flow_architecture.md) - Information flows between components
5. [**Security Architecture**](security_architecture.md) - Security considerations and controls
6. [**Technology Stack**](technology_stack.md) - Recommended technologies for implementation
7. [**Implementation Plan**](implementation_plan.md) - Phased approach to building the system

### Diagrams

The [**diagrams**](diagrams/) directory contains guidelines for creating diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

### Reference Materials

The project's concept and user stories can be found in:

- [Product Concept](../product/concept.md)
- [High-Level User Stories](../product/high_level_user_stories.md)

## Key Components

The architecture revolves around four primary components:

1. **Human Interface** - Entry point for requirements submission and human validation
2. **Task Tracking System** - Central system for managing workflow status and progression
3. **Product Agent** - AI agent that transforms raw requirements into structured specifications
4. **Coding Agent** - AI agent that generates code based on structured requirements

## Key Architectural Principles

The architecture is built on several key principles:

1. **Git-Based Requirements** - Requirements stored as markdown files in Git
2. **Status-Driven Workflow** - Clear task statuses drive the development process
3. **Human Validation Checkpoints** - Strategic points where humans review and approve outputs
4. **Microservices Architecture** - Modular approach that enables isolation and focused development
5. **Event-Driven Communication** - Events coordinate activities between components

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md) to understand the big picture
2. Review the [High-Level Architecture](high_level_architecture.md) for workflows and architectural decisions
3. Explore the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) for detailed component specifications

### For Implementers

1. Review the [Component Architecture](component_architecture.md) for your specific component
2. Consult the [Technology Stack](technology_stack.md) for recommended implementation technologies
3. Follow the [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) for phasing and milestones

### For Security Reviewers

Focus on the [Security Architecture](security_architecture.md) document and security aspects in other documents.

## Maintaining This Documentation

The architecture documentation should be treated as a living set of documents that evolve with the project. When making significant changes to the architecture:

1. Update the relevant architecture documents
2. Update diagrams as needed using Mermaid syntax
3. Document architectural decisions using the ADR format
4. Notify the team of significant architectural changes

## Next Steps

After reviewing the architecture documentation, the recommended next steps are:

1. Set up the core infrastructure for development
2. Begin implementation of the Foundation phase components
3. Establish a regular architecture review process
